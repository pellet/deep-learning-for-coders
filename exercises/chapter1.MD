2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best tool in the world.
- Image Generation
- Biology
- Playing games
- Robotics
- Financial and logistical forecasting

3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the arti‐
ficial neuron?
Mark 1 Perceptron

4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel dis‐
tributed processing (PDP)?
- A set of processing units
- A state of activation
- An output function for each unit
- A pattern of connectivity among units
- A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activites through the network of connectivities
- An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit
- A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
- An environment within which the system must operate

5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neu‐
ral networks?
- Pattern of connectivity aming unit
- Deeper networks were often too big and too slow to be useful

6. What is a GPU?
It's a graphics processing unit, mainly used to render/display 3d environments on a computer for playing games.
It's a special kind of processor that can handle thousands of single tasks at the same time.
